# CrimsonGlow
Repository for the adult spanking RPG Crimson Glow. Written in a combination of Java and Groovy. The program is
 written in Java, the tests are written in Groovy using the Spock Framework.

 Note: As part of my workflow I will be rebasing and force-pushing liberally on branches other than master. Therefore,
 it is _highly_ recommended that you do not branch off anything but master. I will never force push master.
